# Search Queries Anomaly Detection

**Objective**: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in search query data to spot emerging trends or potential issues.

**Process**:
  
    Gather historical search query data.
    Analyze query distribution and frequency.
    Create features for anomaly detection.
    Choose an anomaly detection method (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
    Train the model and apply it to detect anomalies.
    Insight: Anomalies in search queries reveal trends that can guide optimization and improve user engagement.

### Common Challenges Across All Projects:

Data Imbalance: Many anomaly detection tasks have imbalanced data, where anomalies are far less frequent than normal instances.

Real-time Processing: In most cases, especially with network security or IoT, real-time anomaly detection is crucial.

Feature Engineering: Identifying the right features (e.g., transaction amount, user activity, etc.) is key to improving model accuracy.

Model Selection: No single model is perfect; tuning and choosing the correct anomaly detection technique is essential for success.

These projects involve real-world data and can be applied to industries such as finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, e-commerce, and more.
