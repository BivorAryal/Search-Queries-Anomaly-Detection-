    Analyze query distribution and frequency.
    Create features for anomaly detection.
    Choose an anomaly detection method (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
    Train the model and apply it to detect anomalies.
    Insight: Anomalies in search queries reveal trends that can guide optimization and improve user engagement.
